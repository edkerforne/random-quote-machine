This is the source code for my [Random Quote Machine](https://edkerforne.github.io/random-quote-machine/), a React app which displays a random quote from an API.

It was made for the freeCodeCamp [front end libraries challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer). You can see the built code [here](https://github.com/edkerforne/random-quote-machine/tree/gh-pages).
